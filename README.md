A project that was built for one of the more known and celebrated galleries, it was done during a home test where I had to rebuild the landing page with React, HTML and CSS.

Fully responsive and completly hand made without any external libraries, the expanding carousel was made with a help of a project in codepen.
It allowed to take off some of the css rust I've gathered while focusing on external libraries during my internship and I'm happy to showcase this work especially since it took me 3 days.

Enjoy!
